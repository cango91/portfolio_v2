My <b>20-year hobby</b> turned into a dream deferred when family needs called me to the <b>medical field</b>.

                        In my work, I employ <b>cutting-edge</b> technologies and tools, primarily focusing on stacks like <b>MERN</b> and <b>Python/Django/Postgres</b>, enabling me to deliver robust solutions tailored to project requirements.

                        Outside of my professional pursuits, I find balance and inspiration through sailing, snowboarding and bouldering. These activities not only challenge me physically but mentally as well, reflecting my approach to problem-solving in software development. Just like setting a course on open water or finding the next grip on a climb, I approach each project with <b>precision, creativity, and a drive to reach new heights</b>.
